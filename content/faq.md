## Has the Hippocratic License been subject to legal review?
Yes, and we are working with a new team of IP lawyers to release the 2.0 version in mid-February.

## Has the Hippocratic License been reviewed and approved by the Open Source Initiative?
The license will be submitted to the OSI for their review once 2.0 has been released.

## Does the Hippocratic License violate the "No Discrimination" and "Fields of Endeavor" terms of the Open Source Definition?
Those sections state that an Open Source License must not discriminate against any person or group of persons, or against any field of endeavor, respectively.

No Groups or Fields are discriminated against by the Hippocratic License. People in the Groups are welcome to use software under the Hippocratic License in their Fields. The restrictions in the Hippocratic License target specific activities, not groups of people or fields of work. The restrictions apply equally to all people and all groups, in all fields of endeavor. Therefore, the restrictions are not discriminatory in any way.

## Is the Hippocratic License enforceable?
Enforcement is a legitimate concern, but the question of the enforceability of open source licenses in general has still not been tested in the US court system. The landmark case of [Arifex Software, Inc. vs Hancom, Inc.](https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/breach-gpl-license-breach-contract/), involving the alleged breach of the GPL, is often touted as a victory for open source licenses, but the judge in that case did nothing more than deny a motion to dismiss in order for the case to continue. The suit was then settled out of court, leaving the legal enforceability question open.

## What happens if the No Harm clause is determined to be unenforceable?
The language in the [draft 1.2 version of the license](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/hippocratic-license/pull/28) ensures that in this circumstance the license reverts to the same legal enforceability of the unmodified MIT license.

## How do I determine if my company or organization is covered by the No Harm clause?
A good guideline is looking at your organization's conformance to Principles 1 and 2 of the [United Nations Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles). From the commentary: "The weight of international criminal law jurisprudence indicates that the relevant standard for aiding and abetting is knowingly providing practical assistance or encouragement that has a substantial effect on the commission of a crime."

## How do I annotate the Hippocratic License in project documentation?
Use *MIT - Hippocratic 1.2*.
